Notice Board Layout using Atomic CSS 

This project is a static web page that creates a "Notice Board" layout using pure HTML and CSS. It's a practical demonstration of the Atomic CSS (or utility-first) methodology, where each class in the stylesheet has a single, specific purpose. This approach allows for building complex layouts by composing simple, reusable utility classes directly in the HTML.

Features :-

A responsive layout centered on the page using Flexbox.

A nested structure with an outer container (the board) and an inner text box.

Custom styling for backgrounds, fonts, borders (solid and dotted), and padding.

All styling is applied through a set of single-purpose utility classes defined in the CSS file, demonstrating the Atomic CSS principle.

Technologies Used :-

HTML: For the basic structure of the page.

CSS: For all styling, written in an Atomic/Utility-First approach.
